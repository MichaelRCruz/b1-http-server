# b1-http-server

Hello. This is just the start of my exploration into Kotlin. I'd like to see what it is like using this language as a
webserver. The utility of this server is currently not defined and the resources it will serve are yet to be determined.


The first thought as a project idea is a url shortener.

All contructive criticism is welcomed :)
